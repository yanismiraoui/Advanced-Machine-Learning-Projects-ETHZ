# Projects for the Advanced Machine Learning course at ETH Zürich 📚

Please note that these notebooks were used as exploratory tools to obtain the best score possible for the Advanced Machine Learning Projects during the Autumn semester 2021. 🍂 

### ✅ Task 1 - Brain Age Prediction 🧠: To solve this problem with the best score possible, we have mostly used Python with the PyTorch, keras and sklearn libraries. 

### ✅ Task 2 - Heart Rythm Classification 🫀: To solve this problem with the best score possible, we have mostly used Python with the lgbm, xgboost, catboost and sklearn libraries. 

### ✅ Task 3 - Mitral valve segmentation 🩸: To solve this problem with the best score possible, we have mostly used Python with the sklearn, keras and cv2 libraries.
